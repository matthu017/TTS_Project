This page contains relevant OSC training scripts for our project. The first script will create more data samples based on the Tenet paper. The second script will retrain the WaveRNN vocoder using available training data and an updated loss function based on PFP loss and Wav2Vec.  

For size purposes, the LibriSpeech Dataset and Wav2Vec models used for training is not included in this repository.   

You may download the librispeech dataset from the following link: https://www.openslr.org/12  

You may download the Wav2Vec model from the following link: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/blob/main/examples/wav2vec/README.md
